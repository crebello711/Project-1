# Project-1 Proposal
Group Project

Our group seeks to compare the popularity of social media and how it has grown across various countries. We seek to answer the following questions:
-	Is there a relationship between countries and social media platforms (Instagram, Youtube)?
- Is there a relationship between categories and engagement(Instagram, Youtube)?
- To predict the success on a social media platform based upon followers (Instagram, Youtube)?
-	What can the data tell us about the correlation between categories and influencers between both platform?

We are using an intial data source at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/top-1000-social-media-channels?select=social+media+influencers+-+youtube.csv
